# Registrator

This is a fork of <https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator>. \
A Service registry bridge for Docker.

Registrator automatically registers and deregisters services for any Docker
container by inspecting containers as they come online. Registrator
supports pluggable service registries, which currently includes
[Consul](http://www.consul.io/), [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and
[SkyDNS 2](https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns/).

## Using Registrator

The quickest way to see Registrator in action is our
[Quickstart](docs/user/quickstart.md) tutorial.
